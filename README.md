# JOS
Reactivity to JOS in an anagram-solving task.


<h3>Version Planned</h3>

1. Version 1 will allow participants to see all letters for a 2 second preview, then allocate to JOS or control
2. Version 2 only allows them to see 3 of the 5 letters in the preview (so they can't fully solve it)

<h3>Possible Versions</h3>

1. Limit the solving time
2. Manipulate the pronouncability of the scrambled anagrams
3. Change the wording of the JOS (include or don't include the word 'confident'
4. Add some unsolvable anagrams
